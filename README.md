<p>
  This dashboard is a data visualization of my Netflix viewing activity data.
  The data is collected from Netflix's viewing activity page.
  Then, the data is preprocessed and visualized using Python, Pandas, and Dash.

  I am aware that I do not have that much data because I have just started using Netflix.
  Because of this, I added some example data to make the graphs look more interesting.
  However, this code should work for any amount of data.
  This will be removed in the future after I have sufficient data.
  Additionally, I tried to make the dashboard layout as responsive as possible.
  Please do not judge my preference ðŸ˜Š
